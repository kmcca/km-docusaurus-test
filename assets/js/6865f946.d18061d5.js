These methods include build coordinates, SHA-2 file hashes, proprietary byte-code hashes, and filenames. For each identified library, Veracode SCA reports the vulnerabilities based on its vulnerability database. Veracode builds the database using machine learning and natural language processing over a variety of public sources that contain information about open-source libraries. These sources include NVD, GitHub commits, GitHub issues, Jira boards, Bugzilla, mailing lists, vendor advisory lists, and other security-relevant websites and discussion boards. Due to this unique approach, Veracode SCA can identify vulnerabilities that the NVD has not yet reported in addition to the reported vulnerabilities. Veracode goes through every item flagged by the machine learning model, reviews the code where the potential vulnerability was discovered, and confirms if it is a vulnerability. Veracode SCA then adds a CVSS score, descriptions of the vulnerability, and remediation advice to the database."}),"\n",(0,i.jsxs)(n.p,{children:["For more information on how to get started with agent-based scanning, see ",(0,i.jsx)(n.a,{href:"/km-docusaurus-test/r/Understanding_Deployment_Options_for_Agent_Based_Scanning",children:"Understanding deployment options for agent-based scanning"}),"."]})]})}function h(e={}){const{wrapper:n}={...(0,t.a)(),...e.components};return n?(0,i.jsx)(n,{...e,children:(0,i.jsx)(l,{...e})}):l(e)}},11151:(e,n,a)=>{a.d(n,{Z:()=>o,a:()=>r});var i=a(67294);const t={},s=i.createContext(t);function r(e){const n=i.useContext(s);return i.useMemo((function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(n):{...n,...e}}),[n,e])}function o(e){let n;return n=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(t):e.components||t:r(e.components),i.createElement(s.Provider,{value:n},e.children)}}}]);
