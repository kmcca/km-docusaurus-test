Generally speaking, these fall into two categories: vulnerabilities and potential vulnerabilities. Vulnerabilities are exploitable weaknesses in the application, with a code path that can be found and exploited by an attacker to impair the confidentiality of the application, integrity, or availability. Potential vulnerabilities represent weaknesses in the application code that may not be exploitable by an attacker at the present time, either because the code path is unreachable or because some mitigating factor is in place in the code base. However, potential vulnerabilities may become true vulnerabilities in the future if the code architecture or deployment method of the application changes, or if the flawed code is called in another program."}),"\n",(0,a.jsxs)(t.p,{children:["Veracode Static Analysis uses debug information to report the source file and line number on which the flaw exists, aiding in remediation.
