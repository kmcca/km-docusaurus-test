Dynamic Analysis uses an automated penetration testing technique to detect security flaws at runtime. After the automated process is complete, a security technician verifies the output to ensure the lowest false positive rates in the industry. The end result is an accurate list of security flaws for the classes of automated scans applied to the application."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.h2,{id:"veracode-rating-system-using-multiple-analysis-techniques",children:"Veracode rating system using multiple analysis techniques"}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Higher business criticality applications require more comprehensive analysis to accurately score their security quality. Analysis techniques include automated static, automated dynamic, manual penetration testing, and manual review. Because each analysis technique has differing false negative (FN) rates for different types of security flaws, any single analysis technique or even a combination of techniques is more likely to produce a certain level of false negatives. Some false negatives are acceptable for lower business critical applications, therefore, a less expensive analysis using only one or two analysis techniques is acceptable. At higher business criticality the FN rate should be close to zero.
